Fix: Make Chrome Custom Tabs work in Shipping builds (R8/ProGuard, AndroidX, manifest visibility, lifecycle hooks)

Summary:
1. Fixed a Shipping-only regression where Chrome Custom Tabs would not launch due to R8/ProGuard stripping and missing runtime visibility.
2. Added explicit R8 keep rules for AndroidX Browser and plugin bridge classes to prevent code elimination in minified builds.
3. Ensured AndroidX Browser dependency is injected at build time via UPL so the provider is present in Shipping.
4. Added Android 11+ package-visibility queries for Custom Tabs service discovery.
5. Hooked GameActivity lifecycle (onCreate/onStart/onNewIntent) to initialize and forward deep links reliably on cold start and resume.
6. Declared GameActivity launchMode=singleTask and added an intent-filter for the uewebtest:// scheme so deep links route to the correct task.

Features:
1. Shipping-safe Custom Tabs: Stable launch behavior in minified builds with R8 enabled.
2. Lifecycle-aware deep-link handling: Consistent deep link delivery across app fresh launch, resume, and re-entry.
3. AndroidX/Jetifier alignment: Gradle properties enforced for consistent dependency resolution in Shipping.

Changes:
1. UPL: Added R8/ProGuard rules to preserve Custom Tabs classes and GameActivity bridge methods
   - File: Source/Android/ChromeCustomTabs_UPL.xml
   - Rules:
     - -keep class androidx.browser.** { *; }
     - -keep class com.epicgames.unreal.customtabs.** { *; }
     - -keepclasseswithmembers class com.epicgames.unreal.customtabs.** { native <methods>; }
     - -keepclassmembers class com.epicgames.unreal.GameActivity {
         public boolean isChromeCustomTabsAvailable();
         public void openChromeCustomTab(java.lang.String,int,boolean,int,boolean,boolean,boolean);
         public void closeChromeCustomTab();
       }
2. UPL: Injected AndroidX Browser dependency and Gradle flags
   - gradleDependencies: implementation 'androidx.browser:browser:1.7.0'
   - gradleProperties: android.useAndroidX=true, android.enableJetifier=true
3. UPL: Copied Java source into Gradle staging
   - resourceCopies: ChromeCustomTabs.java → $S(BuildDir)/src/...
4. UPL: GameActivity integration
   - Import additions: import com.epicgames.unreal.customtabs.ChromeCustomTabs;
   - Class additions:
     - isChromeCustomTabsAvailable()
     - openChromeCustomTab(String url, int toolbarColor, boolean hasNavBarColor, int navBarColor, boolean showTitle, boolean urlBarHiding, boolean defaultShare)
     - closeChromeCustomTab()
   - Lifecycle additions:
     - onCreate/onStart/onNewIntent now call ChromeCustomTabs.setActivity(this) and forward getIntent() to ChromeCustomTabs.handleDeepLink(...)
5. UPL: Manifest updates
   - GameActivity launchMode=singleTask
   - Intent-filter for deep links:
     - action VIEW + categories DEFAULT/BROWSABLE
     - data android:scheme="uewebtest"
   - Android 11+ package visibility:
     - <queries><intent><action android:name="androidx.browser.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService"/></intent></queries>

Bug Fixes:
1. Root cause: In Shipping, R8 was removing AndroidX Browser and/or the plugin’s Java bridge methods; additionally, package visibility could block Custom Tabs provider discovery on Android 11+, preventing a tab from opening.
2. Fix:
   - Keep-rules pin all required classes/methods so minification doesn’t strip them.
   - Explicit dependency injection guarantees androidx.browser is present in the Shipping artifact.
   - Queries entry enables discovery of Custom Tabs providers at runtime on Android 11+.
   - Lifecycle hooks + singleTask ensure the Activity holds a valid context and receives deep links consistently (cold start, resume, and re-entry).

Tests:
1. Shipping build (minify on): Verified that calling OpenChromeCustomTab now launches the Custom Tab successfully.
2. Deep link loopback: Confirmed deep links are handled in onCreate/onStart/onNewIntent; logs show “Deep Link handled in ...”.
3. Browser compatibility: Validated launch in a Custom Tabs-capable browser (e.g., Chrome/Brave).
4. ABI/device sanity: Tested on device with Android 11+ to confirm package-visibility queries resolve the provider.
5. Regression: Verified Development and Debug builds remain unaffected.

Notes:
- Library version pinned to androidx.browser:1.7.0 for broad compatibility across UE 4.27–5.6. Future upgrade to 1.9.x is feasible with additional testing.
- If further shrinking rules are added, keep the existing keep-rules intact to avoid stripping bridge APIs.

TODO:
1. Consider moving deep-link checks in onNewIntent to use the provided intent parameter for stricter correctness.
2. Add optional R8 keep mapping docs in README to aid downstream teams customizing minify configs.
3. Evaluate migrating to partial/side-sheet Custom Tabs features (1.8.0+) when raising minSdk and testing.

Queue-based sampling, hierarchical trace sections, and visible blanket procedural mesh

Summary:
1. Reworked sampling to a queue-based trace model backed by hierarchical distance/FOV sections.
2. Introduced a �visible blanket� procedural mesh that stamps quads at hit locations with surface-aware normals and colors.
3. Replaced fixed H/V sample counts with FOV-section ratios and distance-based spacing for adaptive resolution.
4. Updated analysis flow to use start/end pairs per sample, handling degenerate traces and precise visibility classification.
5. Anchored the visible blanket component at actor transform while keeping debug components at the observer pivot.
6. Added cached counters for produced samples to aid future diagnostics and UI exposure.

Features:
1. Adaptive sampling: horizontal/vertical section ratios and maximum inter-sample spacing scale with FOV and distance.
2. Visible blanket mesh: per-hit double-sided quads with tangent-space normals and per-vertex color (green visible, red hidden).
3. Deterministic trace ordering: central vertical slice first to preserve existing assumptions in downstream visualization.

Changes:
1. Added ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::ACPP_Actor__Viewshed{Class} in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Created VisibleVisualization_ProceduralMeshComponent (movable, absolute transforms, decals disabled).
   - Set initial sampling defaults, added cached counters initialization.
2. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::Tick() in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Switched processing bounds from TraceEndpoints to TracePointQueue for frame-limited tracing.
3. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::StartAnalysis() in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Generated TracePointQueue; initialized AnalysisResults from per-trace start/end and ground normal.
4. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::ClearResults() in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Cleared TraceSections, TracePointQueue, and cached counters instead of a flat TraceEndpoints array.
5. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::GenerateTraceEndpoints() in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Built orthonormal basis; computed half-FOV radians once; derived section counts from ratios.
   - Calculated sample counts from maximum allowed spacing; produced hierarchical sections and a flattened queue.
   - Emitted central vertical slice first, then remaining rows; removed ground probing (no ground-hugging).
6. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::ProcessSingleTrace(int32) in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:
   - Classified visibility via hit-distance vs target-distance tolerance, handling degenerate traces safely.
7. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::BuildDebug_ProceduralMergedMesh() in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, Specifically:

10. Added FS__ViewShedTracePoint{Struct}, FS__ViewShedTraceEndPoints{Struct}, FS__ViewShedTraceSection{Struct} in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.h, Specifically:
    - Encapsulated per-trace start/end info, indices, support normal, and per-slice sample counts.
11. Modified Sampling Resolution in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.h, Specifically:
    - Replaced HorizontalSamples/VerticalSamples with Horizontal_Sample_Section_Ratio and Vertical_Sample_Section_Ratio.
    - Added Maximum_Distance_Between_Samples and Minimum_Samples_Per_Section for adaptive spacing and sectioning.
12. Added Visualization controls in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.h, Specifically:
    - VisibleVisualization_SurfaceOffset and VisibleVisualization_QuadHalfSize to tune quad placement/sizing.
13. Added components and fields in Source/P_ViewshedAnalysis/CPP_Actor__Viewshed.h, Specifically:
    - UPROPERTY VisibleVisualization_ProceduralMeshComponent; arrays TraceSections and TracePointQueue.
    - Cached counters: CachedHorizontalSampleCount, CachedDistanceBandCount, CachedVerticalSampleCount.

Bug Fixes:
1. Prevented misclassification around endpoints by comparing hit distance to target distance with tolerance.
2. Eliminated basis skew by re-orthonormalizing the actor basis vectors before sampling.
3. Avoided degenerate trace artifacts by early-handling KINDA_SMALL_NUMBER-length rays.

TODO:
1. Optionally rotate debug components with the actor (set world rotation to GetActorRotation()) and transform local geometry accordingly, if actor-aligned shading/normal presentation is desired. [carried over]
2. Evaluate whether procedural mesh normals should be recalculated per-face or aligned with actor rotation for improved lighting consistency. [carried over]
3. Apply HiddenMaterial to invisible blanket geometry (or emit a separate hidden section) inside BuildDebug_ProceduralMergedMesh().

Task: Introduce adaptive, section-driven sampling and a visible blanket procedural mesh; switch to a queue-based trace pipeline and update visualization transforms/materialization accordingly.

Viewshed visualization pivots at viewshed origin; instances/mesh now emitted relative to observer location

Summary:
1. Anchored `Debug_VisiblePointsISMC`, `Debug_HiddenPointsISMC`, and `Debug_ProceduralMeshComponent` to the viewshed origin to fix rotation about world origin.
2. Adjusted instanced point transforms to be relative to the observer location (component-local) for correct pivoting.
3. Adjusted procedural mesh vertices to be relative to the observer location so the mesh rotates around the viewshed origin.
4. Preserved analysis orientation (sampling still driven by actor rotation) while correcting visualization pivot.
5. Verified Editor target builds successfully.

Features:
1. Visualization now rotates around the actual viewshed origin, improving spatial correctness and readability.
2. Consistent, predictable debug visuals for both instanced points and the procedural merged mesh.

Changes:
1. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::UpdateVisualization() in CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, specifically set world location/rotation for:
   - `Debug_VisiblePointsISMC`, `Debug_HiddenPointsISMC`, `Debug_ProceduralMeshComponent` to `GetObserverLocation()` and identity rotation, and enabled absolute location/rotation to anchor at the viewshed origin.
2. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::BuildDebug_PointMesh() in CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, specifically:
   - Computed instance locations as `(Point.WorldPosition - ObserverLoc) + FVector(0,0,10)` to place instances in component-local space relative to the viewshed origin.
3. Modified ACPP_Actor__Viewshed::BuildDebug_ProceduralMergedMesh() in CPP_Actor__Viewshed.cpp, specifically:
   - Emitted vertices as `(Point.WorldPosition - ObserverLoc)` for both visible and hidden sections to ensure the procedural mesh pivots around the viewshed origin.

Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed unintended rotation of debug visualization around the world origin by re-basing components and geometry at the viewshed origin.
2. Eliminated mismatch between analysis frame (actor-based) and visualization pivot (world-based) to prevent visual drift/offset artifacts.

TODO:
1. Optionally rotate debug components with the actor (set world rotation to `GetActorRotation()`) and transform local geometry accordingly, if actor-aligned shading/normal presentation is desired.
2. Evaluate whether procedural mesh normals should be recalculated per-face or aligned with actor rotation for improved lighting consistency.

Tests:
1. Good Enough.

Task: Anchor viewshed debug components and geometry at the viewshed origin so rotations pivot correctly.

Bug Fixes:
1. Resolved undeclared identifier errors (VisiblePointMesh, VisiblePointsISMC, HiddenPointsISMC, ProceduralMeshComponent, bShowDebugLines, DebugLineDuration, PointScale, ViewDirection) by aligning to header-defined Debug_* names and available variables.
2. Prevented potential null dereferences in ClearResults/UpdateVisualization/BuildDebug_* via defensive pointer checks.
3. Fixed incorrect scaling artifacts by using uniform 3-component scale vectors for instances.

Task: Stabilize viewshed debug visualization and restore successful Editor build after revert.
